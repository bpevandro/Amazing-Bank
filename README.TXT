========================
   AMAZING BANK APP
========================

This is the Amazing Bank app, a JAVA app built with fun purposes only. Please, feel free to download and use it for study or whatever reason you may use it for. There are mainly three classes within the app:
* The main Bank Acount class, which handles all the main stuff, such as Customer and Account creation;
* The Account class and
* The Customer class

The Javadoc is also available. However, it may be incomplete or it may not refer to the version you are working with.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)

As always, feedacks and recommendations are always welcome.

Versions overview:
* v1.2 includes new functionalities and menu options, such as Register as a Customer and Customer Information, which retrieves information on a customer (full name, accounts, account types, etc). Also, now the accounts also generate the creation date once an account is created, being retrieved using the option Customer Information.
